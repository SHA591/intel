# AI DRIVEN CYBER RESILIENCE FOR DRONE SWARMS
## Overview:
   ### Moto: Securing 'Swarm Drones' in Military Operations.
   Problem Statement:
        Swarm Drones which are used in military operations are vulnerable to cyber attacks such as GPS spoofing, signal jamming and command injection attacks.
   Proposed Solution:     
        The solution integrates Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, OpenVINO for object detection, and a React dashboard for real-time visualization. The drones communicate through MQTT, sending status updates and anomaly reports to a central control system.
